/*
Looks like it is a memory address. Channels by default are pointers. 
Mostly,when you want to communicate with a goroutine,you pass the channel as an argument to the function or method. 
Hence when goroutine receives that channel as an argument, you donâ€™t need to dereference it to push or pull data from that channel.
